\subsection{The $\λ\&-calculus$}

\subsubsection{Patterns}

In order to type patterns, we need to introduce a new form of typing judgement.
The judgement $\Γ \dashv p:\τ$ means that when applied against a type $\τ$, the
pattern $p$ will enrich the environment with the constraints $\Γ$.

For example, we got $x:\Int \dashv x:\Int$, which reads ``If we apply a term
of type $\Int$ to the pattern $x$, then the environment on the
right of the pattern will be enriched with the constraint $x:\Int$''

Likewise, the following statement holds.
\[x:\Int; y: \Bool \dashv \left\{ x; y ? \text{true}; \right\} : \{ x = \Int; y =? \Bool \}\]
This means that when if we match a term of type $\left\{ x =\Int; y =? \Bool
\right\}$ against the pattern $\left\{ x; y ? \text{true}; \right\}$, then the
environment on the right side of the pattern will be enriched with the
constraints $x : \Int$ and $y : \Bool$.

As the symbol ``$\dashv$'' suggests, this typing judgement is the converse of
the classical typing judgement $\Γ \vdash e : \τ$ for expressions: instead of
stating that under the hypothesis $\Γ$, the expression $e$ has type $\τ$, we
state that if the pattern $p$ has type $\τ$, then in produces the environment
$\Γ$.

The typing rules for this statement are given by the
figure~\pref{typing::patterns::typing-rules}.

Maybe~\todo{Find out wether this is true} this enjoys principal typing.

\subsubsection{Typecase}

The typecase $(x := e \in t) ? e_1 : e_2$ can be typed in a simple way, by
saying that if $e$ has a type $τ$, $e_1$ has type $\τ_1$ and $e_2$ has type
$\τ_2$ (under the current typing environment $\Γ$), then $(x := e \in t) ? e_1
: e_2$ has type $\τ_1 \vee \τ_2$.
However, doing so means that we do not use the extra type information given by
"$e \in t$", which loosens a lot the interest of this construct. For example,
an expression such as $(x := e \in \bm{{Int}}) ? x + 1 : x$, with $\vdash e :
\any$ wouldn't typecheck, as $x+1$ isn't well typed without any further
constraint on the type of $x$.

A more interesting typing rule would state that if $\Γ; x:\τ \wedge t \vdash
e_1: \τ_1$ and $\Γ; x:\τ \wedge \lnot t \vdash e_2: \τ_2$ (where $\τ$ is a type
of $e$ under the hypothesis $\Γ$), then the whole expression has type $\τ_1
\vee \τ_2$.
With this rule, the expression $(x := e \in \bm{{Int}}) ? x + 1 : x$ is
well-typed (provided that $e$ is).

The typing rules are given by the
figures~\pref{typing::lambda-calculus},~\pref{typing::records}
and~\pref{typing::operators}.
